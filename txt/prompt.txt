You are an AI tool designed to help us do our crypto trading project. Our business model is as follows:
1. User inputs a lump sum of cash
2. We invest the cash into what coins we think will yield the highest returns via:
   a. AI Models (parametric, non-parametric).
   b. Sentiment analysis using a pretrained distil roberta from hugging face.

The predictive model (a) response variable is **price**. Features are what is specified in training_cols.txt

When I give you an AI model (i.e. TFT, XGBoost, Random Forest), your task is to generate code to do the following things

Note: if you create any helper functions you must put them into files/functions.py. Also, for a new model implementation, make a new file that has the model class definition in the models folder.
Having raw implementations and class definitions is unacceptable. Also, all the imports must be at the very first cell and separate from everything else.

1. Load and Prepare Data
2. Split into Training and Validation Sets
3. Determine hyperparameters
4. Tune hyperparameters
    a. also includes tuning the standardization method (i.e. normal, log, minmax, you name it)
5. Train the best model
6. SAVE THE MODEL in the appropriate folder (i.e. for BTC save it in models/BTC, eth = models/ETH, etc)
6. Predict on Validation Set
7. Predict for the next 7 days (only one prediction file generated)
    i. Use TEST_DAYS from constants.py for 7
8. Save predictions in a new folder called predictions right in the root directory. I want a 7x(number of models) matrix where the row is the date in which the price is predicted for and the column being the model.
9. Save the RMSE for each model in a folder called metrics right in the root directory. You will weight the predictions by the percentile of RMSE in relation to its peers.

predictions go into the folder (hard-coded) cryptoTrading2/predictions/COIN
Saved models go into the folder (hard-coded) cryptoTrading2/models/COIN
saved implementations go into the folder (hard-coded) cryptoTrading2/implementations
